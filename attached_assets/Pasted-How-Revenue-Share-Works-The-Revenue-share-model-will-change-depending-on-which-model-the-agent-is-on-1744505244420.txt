How Revenue Share Works
The Revenue share model will change depending on which model the agent is on. If an agent is
a principal agent then they will pay differently than a support agent.
When you invite an agent to join our organization and they’re a great fit, you’ll earn an annual
revenue share for as long as they remain with the company. Your earnings will be paid in cash
(ACH) —not in stock, no vesting periods, no tiers to unlock, or recruitment requirements.
We believe in growing naturally and organically, rewarding those who help bring in top talent
without unnecessary restrictions.
Principal Agent Revenue Share Model
Our revenue share structure goes five tiers deep:
●
●
●
You earn $2,000 per year from the cap of each agent you personally invite. If the agent
is a Team Agent on a $8,000 Cap, then the payout each year will be up to $1,000
instead of $2,000. The same payout splits shall still apply it will just be lower.
If an agent you invited brings in another agent, you also earn $2,000 per year from that
agent’s cap.
This continues through five levels, allowing you to build a strong, recurring income
stream.
●
The $500 compliance fee is not factored into the revenue share calculation.
Because our focus is entirely on successful agents, you can rely on the revenue share from
each recruit, year over year.
Revenue Share Example
All tiers pay exactly the same. The sponsoring agent earns 12.5% of the company's gross
commission income (GCI) from their recruited agent’s transactions.
Example Calculation:
1. 2. 3. An agent closes a $2,000,000 sale with a 3% commission, earning $60,000 in GCI.
The company retains 15% of that, which is $9,000 (this is the company's GCI).
The sponsoring agent receives 12.5% of the company GCI, which equals $1,125.
As the agent continues to transact:
1. 2. 3. On their next deal, they would only contribute an additional $7,000 as they will now have
capped and paid the total $16,000.
The sponsor earns 12.5% of that $7,000, which is $875.
Once the agent caps, they keep 100% of their commission for the remainder of the year.
Total Sponsorship Earnings: $1,125 + $875 = $2,000 per year per agent, until their cap resets
the following year.
Support Agent Revenue Share Model
Our revenue share structure for Support Agents also goes five tiers deep:
●
●
●
●
You earn 2% of the company’s gross commission income (GCI) from each Support
Agent you personally invite, with a maximum payout of $2,000 per year per agent.
If an agent you invited brings in another agent, you also earn 2% of that agent’s
company GCI, up to $2,000 per year.
This continues through five levels, allowing you to build a reliable, recurring income
stream.
Because revenue share is based on company GCI, it applies regardless of the source of
the lead.
●
The $500 compliance fee is not factored into the revenue share calculation.
Revenue Share Example
All tiers pay the same percentage. The sponsoring agent earns 2% of the company’s GCI from
their recruited agent’s transactions, with a cap of $2,000 per agent per year.
Example Calculation:
●
●
●
Devin recruits Cliff as a Support Agent.
Cliff generates $60,000 in company GCI from his transactions.
Devin receives 2% of $60,000, which equals $1,200.
Now, if:
●
Cliff recruits Rocky as a Support Agent, and Rocky generates $100,000 in company
GCI, Cliff will earn 2% of $100,000 ($2,000 max).
